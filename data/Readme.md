# Testing Data

The `solver_test.py` file will open a `sudoku.csv` file in this folder, expecting two columns - one for the sudoku and one for the solution.

You can download a file like this from Kaggle for example:

- [1 Million Sudokus](https://www.kaggle.com/bryanpark/sudoku)
- [9 Million Sudokus](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/sudoku)
